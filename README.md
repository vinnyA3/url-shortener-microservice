URL-Shortener-Microservice
==========================

**Description**: A url shortening microservice written in Node/Express/Mongo.
The cool thing here is that the main applicatoin logic is written in a pure,
functional-style. Utilizing functional composition, currying, and monadic interfaces,
I aimed to create a service that is fault-tolerant, pure, and easy to reason about.
